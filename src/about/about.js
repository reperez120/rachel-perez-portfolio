                  While studying human languages as a PhD student at Yale, I developed an interest in computer languages. 
                  That interest inspired me to enroll in Thinkfulâ€™s Full Stack Web Development Program, which I will complete in August 2019.
                  I have developed my programming skills through a number of <Link to="/projects">projects</Link> and through applying syntax analysis methods I learned as a linguistics student.
                  I currently have experience with full-stack web development using technologies that include HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Node, PostgreSQL, Express, Bootstrap, AngularJS, ReactJS. 
                  I also have experience with UX/UI Design and technical writing, as well as with technologies such as GitHub and DBeaver.
                  I am excited to deepen my knowledge in these areas and expand it to others.

                  I am based in the Boston area, but am willing to work remotely or relocate. 
                  Please feel free to <Link to="/contact">contact me</Link> if you have any opportunities that might be a good fit, if you have any questions, 
                  or if you just are interested in discussing the finer points of learning React.
                 When I am not working on programming, I enjoy ice skating and dancing, though I do not necessarily do either very well. 
                I further enjoy photography, drawing, and cooking vegan meals, which I do moderately well.
